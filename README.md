# Air-Quality-Index-AQI-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques that can forecast AQI levels based on relevant environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and concentrations of air pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, and NO2, NH3, SO2, O3.
Air pollution stands as one of the most pervasive environmental hazards of the 21st century, with significant consequences for human health, ecosystem stability, and global climate. Rapid industrialisation, urbanisation, and motorisation have contributed substantially to the rising concentration of harmful pollutants in the atmosphere, particularly in densely populated urban areas. The Air Quality Index (AQI) serves as a vital indicator for assessing and communicating the quality of ambient air, representing the combined effects of several key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, NO₂, CO, O₃, and NH₃. Understanding and accurately forecasting AQI is not only essential for public health safety and environmental management but also for enabling proactive policy formulation and citizen awareness.
Traditionally, AQI forecasting has relied on statistical models and rule-based systems, which are often limited by their inability to handle large volumes of data and capture the complex, nonlinear relationships between multiple pollutant variables and meteorological factors. The advent of data-driven methodologies, particularly in the field of machine learning (ML), has revolutionised the predictive modelling of environmental indicators. Machine learning techniques are well-suited for analysing high-dimensional data and uncovering hidden patterns, making them ideal for improving the accuracy and efficiency of AQI prediction systems.
This thesis presents a machine learning-based air quality prediction system that leverages supervised learning algorithms to forecast AQI values based on multiple pollutant readings. The proposed system follows a structured and systematic workflow that begins with the acquisition of a pollution dataset in CSV format, comprising attributes such as PM2.5, NH₃, O₃, NO₂, SO₂, and CO. These pollutants have been identified by numerous studies and global monitoring agencies as key determinants of urban air quality. The dataset is subjected to rigorous preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, normalisation of feature scales, encoding of categorical variables if necessary, and partitioning into training and test subsets.
